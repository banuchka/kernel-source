Subject: bnxt: do not busy-poll when link is down
Patch-mainline: v4.9-rc7
Git-commit: 867d1212bf3c53dc057f7bca72155048cc51d18c
References: bnc#1038583

When busy polling while a link is down (during a link-flap test), TX
timeouts were observed as well as the following messages in the ring
buffer:

bnxt_en 0008:01:00.2 enP8p1s0f2d2: Resp cmpl intr err msg: 0x51
bnxt_en 0008:01:00.2 enP8p1s0f2d2: hwrm_ring_free tx failed. rc:-1
bnxt_en 0008:01:00.2 enP8p1s0f2d2: Resp cmpl intr err msg: 0x51
bnxt_en 0008:01:00.2 enP8p1s0f2d2: hwrm_ring_free rx failed. rc:-1

These were resolved by checking for link status and returning if link
was not up.
